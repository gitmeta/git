# Git


Version control system for humans.

You donâ€™t have to be a hardcore developer to use git anymore, Git aims to enable everyone to use a version control system for any document type.

A version control system allows you to track changes on your files and documents and edit them without fear, you will always be able to go back in time and recover a previous version or compare the differences.

These systems are widely used in software development, but it is a tool that could be used for many other activities, anything involving a workflow that can change over time, for example your homework, thesis or a book you might be writing.

Git is the most popular version control system, and can be found on most platforms and devices.

Just like using git from the Terminal, but better.


Features:
- Create or open a repository.
- Commit changes.
- Review the history/log.
- Revert to a previous state.
- Clone, Pull, Push, Edit, remotes.
- Unpack a repository.


No requirements and dependencies
Seriously, this version of git is fully native for MacOS and iOS, and you need nothing additional to create a repository and start tracking your files and documents.


Privacy and analytics
We value your privacy above all, and we are very serious about it. Git does NOT connect to any of our servers at any time, in fact, it is fully functional without an internet connection. Your credentials (name and email) are only used to sign your commits, but these are only stored in your device.

We know that tracking user experience, and analytics in general has many advantages, but they come to a higher cost: privacy. Therefore we decided to NOT implement any kind of analytics at all. Whatever you do with your repositories and how you use Git is up to you.

How many other apps you have can say the same?
We have been there, working for those corporations, and we believe there is a better way.


Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
